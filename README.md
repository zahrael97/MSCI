Peptide identification by mass spectrometry relies on the interpretation of fragmentation spectra based on the m/z pattern, relative intensities, and retention time (RT). Given a proteome, we wondered how many peptides generate very similar fragmentation spectra with current MS methods. MSCI is a Python package built to assess the information content of peptide fragmentation spectra, we aimed calculating an information-content index for all peptides in a given proteome would enable us to design data acquisition and data analysis strategies that generate and prioritize the most informative fragment ions to be queried for peptide quantification.
