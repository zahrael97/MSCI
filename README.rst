Peptide identification by mass spectrometry relies on the interpretation of fragmentation spectra based on the m/z pattern, relative intensities, and retention time (RT). Given a proteome, we wondered how many peptides generate very similar fragmentation spectra with current MS methods. MSCI is a Python package built to assess the information content of peptide fragmentation spectra, we aimed calculating an information-content index for all peptides in a given proteome would enable us to design data acquisition and data analysis strategies that generate and prioritize the most informative fragment ions to be queried for peptide quantification.

Installation:
==================
prerequisites:

- Python 3.8 -3.11
- Anaconda
- Matchms



Example:
==================
Here is a small example of using MSCI to calculate pairwise normalized spectral angle 
.. testcode::

    from MSCI.Preprocessing_data import read_msp_file
    from MSCI.grouping.groups import MassContentInformation, process_data
    from MSCI.similarity.Similarity import  joinPeaks, nspectraangle
    from MSCI.utils import process_combin, parallel_function
    import numpy as np
    import multiprocessing as mp
    from functools import partial
    from multiprocessing import Pool, cpu_count
    File= 'MSCA_Package/Tryptic_peptides/Dataset/msp_files/charge2_3myPrositLib.msp'
    mz_irt_df = read_msp_file(File)
    g = MassContentInformation(mz_irt_df)
    group = g.group_sequences(1,10, unit='Da')
    group = np.array(group, dtype=object)
    combin = process_data(group)
     # Create a partial function of process_combin with relevant_spectra and other parameters
     process_combin_partial = partial(process_combin, spectra=relevant_spectra, tolerance=1, ppm=0)
     # Determine the number of CPU cores available
     num_cores = cpu_count()
     # Use a Pool to parallelize the processing
     with Pool(num_cores) as pool:
         results = pool.map(parallel_function, updated_combin_chunk)

Should output 
a list of peptides and their spectral angles


Installation
==================
